/**
 * Roman numeral calculator should convert arabic numbers to
 * 
 * Roman numerals. Consider whether this means an array with 
 * 
 * places for Is, Vs, Xs, etc. Try to do up to 20 to simply
 * 
 * problem for now. Consider how every 5 numbers there is a 
 * 
 * 'less one' function (for 4, 9, 14, & 19). Consider that 
 * 
 * you only need three Roman numerals (I, V, & X) to count to
 * 
 * 20. However, you need up to 5 'places' to write numbers
 * 
 * through 20 (XVIII being the specific example).
